# Student Management System

## Overview
The **Student Management System** is a Python-based application that helps manage student records efficiently using a MySQL database. The system allows users to add, update, delete, and view student details such as name, roll number, course, and contact information.

## Features
- Add new students with necessary details.
- Update existing student records.
- Delete student records.
- View all students' information in a structured format.
- Search for specific students using various filters.
- Secure database connection with MySQL.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Database Management System:** MySQL
- **Database Connector:** MySQL Connector for Python

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:
1. **Python (3.x recommended)**
2. **MySQL Server**
3. **MySQL Connector for Python** (`pip install mysql-connector-python`)

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone this repository or download the project files:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/student-management-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd student-management-system
   ```
3. Install the required Python package:
   ```sh
   pip install mysql-connector-python
   ```
4. Create a MySQL database and table:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE student_db;
   USE student_db;
   CREATE TABLE students (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
       roll_number VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
       course VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
       contact VARCHAR(15)
   );
   ```
5. Configure database connection in the Python script (e.g., `config.py`):
   ```python
   db_config = {
       "host": "localhost",
       "user": "your_username",
       "password": "your_password",
       "database": "student_db"
   }
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the main Python script:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
2. Follow on-screen instructions to interact with the Student Management System.

## Future Enhancements
- GUI implementation using Tkinter or PyQt.
- Role-based access control (admin/user permissions).
- Advanced search and filtering options.
